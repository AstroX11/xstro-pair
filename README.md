### Xstro_Pair 

#### Simple pairing code for xstro bot, used to get session id to connect and run the botto lol,

<p>I had to made it because no normal user would have all the time to scan qr in a development terminal for goodness sake</p>
<p>Well for real I don't know what the hell I'm saying, and I will not provide source code for storing session, since we have some peskey dangerous mfs up and down will to steal your session at all cost, basically i'm broke lol and i don't hjave money to pay for hosting, so i host on render, i belive render is safe to some degree.</p>

### SETUP

<p>For the so called "nerds" that don't trust me or just wanna run locally or revere enginner, look below and help yourself</p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AstroX11/xstro-pair
```

```bash
yarn install
```
<p>I hate using npm to install, i feel it's too slow, and yarn look more clean and faster (for me) agrue with your phone screen and this text lol</p>

```bash
npm start
```
<p>Run and pair motherf*** yeah boy, it starts and then put phone number and pair, once you enter and pair the creds and etc are save to a temp server on render it will only last for 2wks</p>

<p>you can even check the direct broswer usage by using get method</p>
